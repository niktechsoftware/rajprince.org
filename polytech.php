              		<p>The Civil Engineering Department offers a six semester course in Civil Engineering that leads to a diploma in Civil Engineering.</p>
              		<p> The workshops/laboratories are equipped with latest equipments for all segments of study and high end facilities are also provided to our students. We are equipped with survey lab, soil lab, material testing lab, applied mechanics lab, hydraulics lab, concrete lab, levelling</p>
                    <p>To get the students well acquainted with the field of knowledge, experts from various areas are invited to have interaction with the students. The department also arranges field visits for the students to see practices going on in the field.</p>
                    <p>The students are imparting training in the various department of Civil Engineering during the course period for getting field knowledge. </p>
<p>Our mission is to develop graduates capable of contributing to and   advancing the practice of civil engineering and construction management   and their sub-disciplines.</p>
                    <p>Our faculty actively participates in scholarly research activities,   allowing us to be up-to-date in our areas of expertise and to   incorporate research into our teaching. Through research, we contribute   to finding better ways of developing and managing our vital civil   infrastructure systems, including transportation, water   supply/distribution, and waste disposal.</p>
                    <p>Students also join in research teams, which give them invaluable,   hands-on experience that will prepare them for professional or research   careers.</p>
                    <p>Faculty members teach undergraduate as well as graduate students.   Thus, students are exposed to instructors who are in the forefront of   their fields and who are frequently working on projects and topics of   current interest, often within the region. Full-time faculty members are   augmented by an excellent group of adjunct faculty who teach specialty   courses in areas of their expertise, bringing a strong practical   applications element to the classroom.</p>

       	  <h2>Join the Mechanical Engineers Who are Changing the World</h2>
          <p>It’s not an overstatement to say that mechanical engineers   are changing the world. These dedicated professionals continue to push   the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer,   cheaper, and more efficient machines— from aircraft carriers to   household appliances. </p>
          <p>WPI’s Mechanical Engineering department provides students   with a solid foundation in the engineering sciences and a strong   grounding in practical, problem-solving skills. This combined approach,   along with hands-on project experiences, makes WPI graduates ready and   able to hit the ground running and add value from the very start of   their careers.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          Faculty and students in the Department of   Mechanical and Aerospace carry out research in diverse areas such as   smart materials, complex dynamical systems, biomimetics, nanomaterials,   energy systems, fire propagation, and bio-fluid mechanics. The main   research in the department in carried out through 4 laboratories: the   Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory, the Mechatronics   Laboratory, Composite Materials and Mechanics Laboratory, and the <a href="http://faculty.poly.edu/%7Emporfiri/index.htm">Dynamical Systems Laboratory</a>.   The labs concentrate on research related to the development,   deployment, and utilization of advanced biomimetic smart systems and   materials, and electromechanical systems.</div>

            <p>The Diploma in Marine Engineering is a three-year full-time course,   which includes a 6-week Industrial Training Programme with approved   establishments. The course structure is modularised to enhance learning   and to provide flexibility of the course design. </p>
            <h3>Practical Training</h3>
            <p>The structure of the diploma programme provides for this in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Through intensive training in our fully equipped workshops and laboratories specifically designed for hands-on learning.</li>
              <li>Through a structured 6-week Industrial Training Programme with approved industrial organisations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, mandatory safety courses in Fire Fighting and Fire   Prevention, Personal Survival Techniques, Elementary First Aid, Personal   Safety and Social Responsibility, and Tanker Familiarisation are   conducted during the course. </p>
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>Students' performance and progress are evaluated through a   combination of in-course and end-of-semester assessment. Each module is   assessed according to its aims and objectives and may take the form of   written and practical examinations, assignments, projects and oral   presentations. A satisfactory standard must be attained during the   Industrial Training Programme.</p>
