                <p>The full range of operations in which a nation&rsquo;s naval forces may be   involved is vast, ranging from high intensity war fighting at one end to   humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations at the other   end. This broad continuum of operations can be broken down into distinct   roles, each demanding a specific approach to the conduct of operations.   Accordingly, the four main roles envisaged for the IN are as follows: -</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Military</li>
                  <li> Diplomatic</li>
                  <li> Constabulary</li>
                  <li> Benign</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> The Military Role</h3>
                <p>The essence of all navies is their military character. In fact, the   raison d&rsquo;etre of navies is to ensure that no hostile maritime power can   degrade own national security and interests. The navy&rsquo;s military role is   characterised by the threat or use of force at and from the sea. This   includes application of maritime power in both offensive operations   against enemy forces territory and trade, and defensive operations to   protect own forces, territory and trade. The military role is performed   through the accomplishment of specific military objectives, missions and   tasks.</p>

                <h3> The Diplomatic Role</h3>
                <p>Naval Diplomacy entails the use of naval forces in support of foreign   policy objectives to build &lsquo;bridges of friendship&rsquo; and strengthen   international cooperation on the one hand, and to signal capability and   intent to deter potential adversaries on the other. The larger purpose   of the navy&rsquo;s diplomatic role is to favourably shape the maritime   environment in the furtherance of national interests, in consonance with   the foreign policy and national security objectives. Navies inherently   lean towards performing a diplomatic role on account of two   characteristics. The first is their status as comprehensive instruments   of a country&rsquo;s sovereign power, whereupon their very presence in or off a   certain area signals the nation&rsquo;s political intent and commitment to   pursue national interests in that region. Hence, their presence or   absence can be calibrated to send a political message to potential   friends and foes alike. The second characteristic facilitating the   navy&rsquo;s diplomatic role is in the very attributes of maritime forces,   including access, mobility, sustenance, reach, flexibility and   versatility. These combine to offer a variety of tools for furthering   national interests and pursuing foreign policy goals. Naval forces can   be readily deployed, can perform multiple roles and tasks that can be   calibrated in visibility and intensity as per requirements, and can just   as easily and rapidly be withdrawn, to send a countersignal.</p>

                <h3> Constabulary Role</h3>
                <p>The increasing incidence of maritime crime has brought into sharp   focus the constabulary role that navies have to perform. The   significance of this role may be gauged from the fact that for a third   of the world&rsquo;s navies, this is a major facet of their functions. In the   constabulary role, forces are employed to enforce law of the land or to   implement a regime established by an international mandate. Force is   only employed for self-defence or as a last resort in execution of this   role. The protection and promotion of India&rsquo;s maritime security is one   of the prime responsibilities of the Indian Navy. This includes a   constabulary element, especially where it relates to threats that   involve use of force at sea. The range of tasks that the IN has to   undertake in the constabulary role ranges from Low Intensity Maritime   Operations (LIMO) to maintaining good order at sea. This further   includes aspects of coastal security, as part of India&rsquo;s overall   maritime security. Constabulary tasks at sea are neither the primary nor   the sole mandate of the IN. With the establishment of the ICG in   February 1978, law enforcement aspects of the constabulary role within   the Maritime Zones of India (MZI) have been transferred to the ICG.28   Security in major harbours and ports are the purview of the port   authorities, aided by customs and immigration agencies. Constabulary   tasks beyond the MZI are vested with the Indian Navy. Efficient and   effective maritime constabulary requires proper and seamless   coordination between the various maritime law enforcement and regulatory   agencies. After the terrorist attacks on Mumbai on 26 November 2008,   the overall responsibility for coastal security has been mandated to the   Indian Navy, in close coordination with the ICG, State marine police   and other central/state government and port authorities.</p>

                <h3> Benign Role</h3>
                <p>The &lsquo;benign&rsquo; role is so named because violence has no part to play in   its execution, nor is the potential to apply force a necessary   prerequisite for undertaking these operations. Examples of benign tasks   include humanitarian aid, disaster relief, Search and Rescue (SAR),   ordnance disposal, diving assistance, salvage operations, hydrographic   surveys, etc. Maritime forces, because of their quick mobilisation, are   extremely useful in the early stages of a crisis for providing relief   material, first aid and succour. Much of the capacity to perform these   functions derives itself from the mobility, reach and endurance inherent   in naval task forces, coupled with their sealift capability. For   example, in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, one of the   biggest challenges is the disbursement of food, water and relief   material. It is under such conditions that military mobility, coupled   with reliable communications are most effective in ensuring distribution   to even the most remote afflicted areas. While specialised civilian   agencies may take over at a later stage, maritime forces can provide the   first helping hand and may be deployed to complement their efforts. The   ICG is the designated national agency for SAR. Naval units may also be   called upon to undertake SAR operations, as required.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size:20px; line-height:30px; color:#333; margin-left:30px;">Indian Army</h2><br><br>
                <p align="justify">Grit and experience   affect the growth of an institution. Fighting four major wars,   insurgency and other low intensity wars has indeed made the Indian Army   an eminently and efficient battle trained, war machine.</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="http://indianarmy.nic.in/writereaddata/images/strength/str%20%2819%29.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="350" border="0"></p>
                <p align="justify">Changing times bring   changing needs. Battle training must tell also on the structuring of the   army, for it is this function that extracts the most from the assets   available, both men and material. A look at the command and structuring   of the Indian Army shows how finely these have been tuned to meet   India's threat perceptions, based on the experience of the major wars   that it has fought and the present-day geo-political context.</p>
                <p align="justify">The largest standing   volunteer Army in the world has never had to scour the populace for   draft or conscription. There are always more men eager to don olive   green than the demand at any one time. But this does not reflect a   situation where a large unemployed workforce would get into uniform to   keep body and soul together. More to the point is the basic attitude of   our people to the call of arms, discovered also by the British, some   three centuries before. There are very many who join up for long service   tenures under the colours, by inclination and choice - also familial   habit and honour. If a young man or woman, sound of body and mind, and   of Indian origin, is inclined to spend most of his useful working years   in the kind of desolation that the country's Field areas' adjoining the   borders provide, can he or she cannot be refused.</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="http://indianarmy.nic.in/writereaddata/images/strength/str.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="372" border="0"></p>
                <p align="justify">For the purpose of   recruitment, the country is divided into recruiting zones. Every zone is   allotted a quota for recruitment based on a percentage of its   population and ethnic grouping. A legacy, slowly being diluted, is that   of combat arm units or regiments recruiting from a particular zone or   mixture of ethnic groups.</p>
                <p align="justify">Once a man has joined   up, it is for keeps. Many fall out at the basic training stage when they   find that there is much more to it than getting into a smart uniform.   The one who hear the sound of the trumpet clearly without missing a   note, take their oath and for the greatness of the nation go into   service - not servitude.</p>
